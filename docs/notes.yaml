General:
  - Vendor neutral data models written in YANG #Define the modesl that communicate to a switch to configure things.
  - Created from customers / Operators
  - Model based configuration.  Data ia structured
  - Replacement for SNMP
  - Need a unique model for all network devices.

YANG:
  - RFC 6020
  - Model definition language
  - Yet Another Generation.
  - Created early 2000's.
  - Best thing at the time for modeling language.
  - Operators already knew YANG structure.
  - http://ops.openconfig.net/branches/models/ #Gives you the tree structure visualization tells you what the yang model is leaf, leaf-list, container etc.
  YANG: #From RFC 6020
    container: a reference to child nodes container nodes do not have a value and holds a single argument.  Fixed set of attributes.
    leaf nodes: contains data like a integer or a string it has a single value
    leaf-list nodes: sequence of leaf nodes holding a value each leaf
    list: Collections of containers

#Example of a YANG model
module bleh {
Container foo  {
    list bar  {
        key baz;
        leaf baz{
            type string;
        }
    }
}
}

^^^^
module: blah
  +--rw foo
      +-- bar* [baz]
          type    string

  - containers #entity
  list: #Collections has KV's you identify keys to the list.
    - baz is the key to the list above

#This can be accessed within the path of /foo/bar/baz

  - get - Takes in a path and returns data from the tree
  - Replace - Replace a tree with another
  - Delete - Deletes a subtree at path
  - subscribe - If using GNMI streams the model
  - update - Updates the tree

snmp_limitations: #Show a slide with 2.3.34.4.2.5.2.34.
  - Polling method.
  - Read write mibs
  - single udp transport
  - older than me.
  - Poor performance for bulk data(UDP) ie acls millions, bgp routes millions
  - mid design
  - Difficult for replacement of cli completely or config completely or to manage the entire state

syslog_limitations:
  - UDP transport
  - Non structured data
  - Every vendor is different
